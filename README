dja-n-go
=============

>>>>> Introduction

A simple tool for creating a new django project (and all the goodies e.g. virtualenv, git, ...), with a customised directory layout.

Currently tested on Windows and Linux. If you'r a mac user take off the platform.system() check in main() and let me know if it workd :)

>>>>> Usage

	dja-n-go.py -n name_of_the_project -b project_root_directory

or follow the onscree prompts:

	dja-n-go.py

>>>>> Some notes
	- Django's manage.py has been altered to force all new apps to be placed in ./apps
	- You must activate the virtualenv (in ./virtualenv) for the project before using manage.py or django-admin.py
	- That's it!
